## ðŸ”§ Past Experience

### VM and K8s Infrastructure @ AT&T and Microsoft (2019 - 2024)
- Software Engineering / DevSecOps / SRE

Beginning in 2019, I worked with various teams across AT&T's 'Network Cloud' platform, through its acquisition by Microsoft in 2021, until November 2024. I had hands-on experience building and operating this platform as it evolved from serving Virtual Machines on OpenStack to a fully managed Kubernetes service offering leveraging Cluster API.
