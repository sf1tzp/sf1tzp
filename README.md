#  Hey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Steven.

## ðŸ”§ Past Experience

### VM and K8s Infrastructure @ AT&T and Microsoft (2019 - 2024)
- Software Engineering / DevSecOps / SRE

Beginning in 2019, I worked with various teams across AT&T's 'Network Cloud' platform, through its acquisition by Microsoft in 2021, until November 2024. I had hands-on experience building and operating this platform as it evolved from serving Virtual Machines on OpenStack to a fully managed Kubernetes service leveraging Cluster API.

I have experience with a wide range of cloud-native technologies and practices; our team was responsible 'end-to-end' for the baremetal provisioning services. As an engineer on the team, I:
- Contributed to several different codebases in Go, Rust, and Bash.
- Maintained Linux configurations in code.
- Maintained CICD and the software supply chain.
- Refined observability code, built dashboards, and defined alert conditions.
- Responded to pages, led mitigation efforts, conducted post-incident reviews, and delivered documentation and bug fixes as necessary.
